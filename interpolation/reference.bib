abstract = {Abstract We construct an ungraded version of Beilinson–Ginzburg–Soergel's Koszul duality for Langlands dual flag varieties, inspired by Beilinson's construction of rational motivic cohomology in terms of K\$K\$-theory. For this, we introduce and study categories DKS(X)\$\hbox{DK}\_\mathcal {S}(X)\$ of S\$\mathcal {S}\$-constructible K\$K\$-motivic sheaves on varieties X\$X\$ with an affine stratification. We show that there is a natural and geometric functor, called Beilinson realisation, from S\$\mathcal {S}\$-constructible mixed sheaves DSmix(X)\$\hbox{D}^{mix}\_\mathcal {S}(X)\$ to DKS(X)\$\hbox{DK}\_\mathcal {S}(X)\$. We then show that Koszul duality intertwines the Betti realisation and Beilinson realisation functors and descends to an equivalence of constructible sheaves and constructible K\$K\$-motivic sheaves on Langlands dual flag varieties.},
